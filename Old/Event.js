    <p>Hertz is an electronic music label for Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Electro and Techno. The of the event that are organised by Hertz are dark defined by the dark Electro music that is performed. This label invests in music that are defined by cultural principles of ethics. In this way we can shape the future of new coming genre and create the greatest potential for the development of electronic music.</p>
    <p>The event references the current political and cultural principles and wants to invest in cultural elements which stabilise our society so to say; economics, healthcare, ethics and personal activity. The event is inspired by neuroscience and the sounds in the music hold the iconic element of mental archetypes. We want to inform how theories of mental behaviour is informed within our culture and give new perspective on these visions. Therefor to say we believe that within our festival someone can come to an understanding of how behaviour should be defined and the way someone can think about this.</p>
    <p>The event is based on the concept that neurological principles are relevant as a cultural concept that is part of the integration of music into society. This definition is related to multiple aspect that are part of Hertz. Based on the scientific concept of singularity which proposes a multidimensional frame of reference of a reference of causality we have define principles for our society to integrate complex technology. The structure of our society and the way it has developed could be defined by complex integrated model that is developed by unconscious motives and external projection. Based on aspect that are defined by modern expectation we have cultural integration is negatively influenced because of irrational concept that are proposed by interpretation of current definition of society.</p>
